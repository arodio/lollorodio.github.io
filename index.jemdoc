== About me
\n
I am a *postdoctoral researcher* at *Linköping University*, *Sweden*, working with *[https://liu.se/en/employee/erila39 Prof. Erik G. Larsson]* and *[https://liu.se/en/employee/zhech93 Prof. Zheng Chen]* on *decentralized learning*. 

Previously, I completed my PhD at Inria, France, working with [http://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Giovanni.Neglia/ Dr. Giovanni Neglia] on *federated learning*. 

My research focuses on designing scalable distributed algorithms for efficient use of data and system resources. I employ mathematical tools from distributed optimization and statistical learning theory.\n
